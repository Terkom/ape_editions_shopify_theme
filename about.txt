What are ape editions?
When the Bored Ape Yacht Club aped into existence in May 2021, few anticipated the profound impact it would have on society. Bored Apes have now become a status symbol synonymous with celebrities, musicians, TV personalities, notorious degens, artists, influencers, and more. The fact that BAYC holders can leverage the intellectual property rights to their NFTs is revolutionary! The true implications of that have yet to be seen in the metaverse. Until now.

Ape Editions is a publishing platform for physical art prints of NFTs that are owner-verified through the Ethereum Blockchain. We collaborate with the authentic and notable NFT owners who are moving this ecosystem forward, with the goal of bringing fans and collectors closer together. In doing so, not only are we preserving the future’s history as art, but we’re building value into the existing IP, which in turn creates utility for current and future NFT projects.

Ape Editions is not limited to just BAYC, but all top projects that grant IP rights to the owners. Every Ape Edition will be different, with ultra-rare variants randomly mixed in to give everyone an equal shot at collecting something special.


how does it work?
Each sale will only be open for a short period of time. Some editions will be limited in number; others will be limited in time.

A few ultra-rare print variants will be mixed in with each edition at random so that everyone has an equal opportunity to collect something extra special.

Upon closing of a sale, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain containing full details of the run, which is also embedded on the print itself and Certificate of Authenticity. The historical provenance of an artwork can be verified anywhere by anyone, forever.

Art prints are packed and shipped from Ape Editions headquarters in Detroit, Michigan. Expect delivery 4-6 weeks from purchase, unless when otherwise noted.
